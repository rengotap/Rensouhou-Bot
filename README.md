Rensouhou-bot Program

Status: Final Version Retired as of 6/20/2020
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rensouhou is a jack of all trades type Discord bot programmed in Node.js and is based on the Discord.js framework. Hosted on Glitch.com.
The project ran from 2018-2020 lasting almost exactly two years. It was a great learning experience that helped me pick my college major.
Named after Yamato bot who's creator (Sphexator) helped me get started hosting the bot.
I've chosen to and add both the legacy Mk.I (1.7 Final) and the last version of the Mk.II (2.3 Experimental) to Github so future PCH members can take inspiration and learn.

Please refer to the README found in Rensouhou ver 2.3 for information about it's capabilities and the reason it had to be shut down.
No individual README available for Rensouhou ver 1.7.
