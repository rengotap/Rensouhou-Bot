Rensouhou-bot version 2.3.0
Experimental Development Version

Status: Retired as of 6/20/2020

On Saturday, June 13 at 7:56 a.m. EST Rensouhou's hosting service began blocking automatic ping services.
The money and time required to keep Rensouohou fully operational became too high for our group to maintain.
Because of this, we will were forced to retire Rensouhou as the Peachtree Robotics Alliance's main bot.
The bot was finally retired on June 20th 2020, after a fruitful two year long career.
